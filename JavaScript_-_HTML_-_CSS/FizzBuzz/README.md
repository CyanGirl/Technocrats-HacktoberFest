# WebApp for FizzBuzz

`Designed and Created by Sufiyan` [Github](https://www.github.com/suffisme)

> Created the webapp that shows fizz buzz program in GUI manner.
> It works like a counter and for the current value it shows the required output on central element.

## Working:
- Using JS DOM and style methods of DOM to impart dynamic colors
- innerHTML to change text content 
- use SetTimeOut to give time lapse of 0.5 second between two values
