## Shortly explain
-> In the case of the missionaries and the giants, three missionaries and three giants must cross the river using a boat that can carry about two people,
under the barrier that, in both banks, if there are missionaries in the bank, there are no cannibals (otherwise the giants would have eaten the missionaries).
A boat cannot cross a river on its own without people on board. And, in contrast, one of the human cannons has only one arm and cannot paddle.

-> In the case of jealous husbands, missionaries and cannibals become three married couples, with the obstacle that no woman can exist for another man without
her husband present. Under this barrier, there would be no more women and men in the bank and more women than men, because if they did, these women would not 
be without their husbands. 

-> Therefore, in transforming men into missionaries and women into cannibals, any solution to the problem of jealous husbands will also 
be a solution to the missionary problem and the cannibalism problem.
